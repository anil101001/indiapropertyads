## 🔧 **If Something Doesn't Work**

### **Page Shows 404:**
- ✅ Already fixed! The `_redirects` file handles this.
- If still happening, check that `_redirects` file was uploaded.

### **Images Not Loading:**
- Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R)
- Check browser console for 404 errors

### **Voice Agent Not Working:**
- This is expected - voice recognition needs browser permissions
- The UI will still work, just simulated responses

### **Blank White Screen:**
- Open browser console (F12)
- Look for JavaScript errors
- Usually means a file didn't upload correctly - try re-upload
